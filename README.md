# 🌩️ CloudSim Hybrid Round Robin Load Balancing Algorithm

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a **research-grade cloud computing simulation** using CloudSim to demonstrate the effectiveness of a custom **Hybrid Round Robin Load Balancing Algorithm**. Think of it as a smart restaurant management system:

- **Cloudlets** = Customer orders (tasks to be processed)
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)** = Kitchen staff (workers processing tasks)
- **Datacenters** = Restaurant kitchens (infrastructure locations)
- **Load Balancer** = Restaurant manager (distributes work efficiently)

### 🆚 Traditional vs. Hybrid Round Robin

| **Traditional Round Robin** | **Hybrid Round Robin** |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Assigns tasks in simple rotation | **Smart assignment** based on worker capacity |
| Ignores task complexity | **Considers task size and priority** |
| Fixed time allocation | **Dynamic time quantum** based on workload |
| No load monitoring | **Real-time load balancing** with task migration |
| One-size-fits-all approach | **Adaptive scheduling** for optimal performance |

## 📌 Purpose of the Project

This is a **research-grade load balancing simulation** designed to optimize cloud computing performance through:

- **VM-aware logic**: Assigns tasks based on virtual machine capabilities
- **Cloudlet-aware logic**: Considers task characteristics (size, priority, complexity)
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Adjusts scheduling based on real-time system load
- **Performance optimization**: Aims to reduce response time, improve resource utilization, and minimize SLA violations

**Key Goal**: Demonstrate how intelligent load balancing can outperform traditional Round Robin by 15-25% in real-world cloud environments.

- **Task Types**: Short (33%), Medium (33%), Long (33%)
- **Priority Levels**: 1 (High) to 3 (Low) based on task length

- **RAM**: 512 MB per VM
- **Bandwidth**: 1000 Mbps per VM
- **Storage**: 10 GB per VM
- **Cores**: 1 PE (Processing Element) per VM

## 🔬 Hybrid Algorithm Explained

The custom algorithm combines insights from three research papers to create an intelligent load balancing solution:

### Step 1: Weighted VM Selection
**Formula**: `Weight = MIPS × PEs + RAM + Bandwidth`

**Purpose**: Strong VMs (high weight) get assigned heavy jobs, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

**Example**: A VM with 2000 MIPS, 1 PE, 1024 MB RAM, and 2000 Mbps bandwidth gets weight = 2000×1 + 1024 + 2000 = 5024.

### Step 2: Task-Length and Priority Awareness
Each cloudlet is assigned:
- **Length (MI)**: 100k-400k Million Instructions
- **Priority (1-3)**: 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low

**Sorting Logic**: Priority DESC, Length DESC
- High-priority, long tasks get processed first
- Prevents large tasks from blocking smaller ones

### Step 3: Smart Assignment Logic
1. Sort VMs by weight (highest first)
2. Check current load on each VM
3. Skip overloaded VMs (load > average + threshold)
4. Assign tasks proportionally based on VM capacity

### Step 4: Dynamic Quantum Calculation (Paper 3)
**Formula**: `Quantum = (BT₁ - BT₂) + BT₃`

Where BT₁, BT₂, BT₃ are the top-3 burst times in the system.

**Purpose**: Prevents excessive context switching by adapting time slices to workload characteristics.

### Step 5: Multi-Phase Scheduling
1. **Static Phase**: Initial smart assignment using weighted selection
2. **Dynamic Phase**: Mid-execution load balancing
3. **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous adjustment and task migration

### Step 6: Load Monitoring + Migration
**Logic**: 
- Monitor VM loads continuously
- If VM load > threshold, identify overloaded VMs
- Migrate 1-2 tasks from overloaded to idle VMs
- Recompute weights dynamically
